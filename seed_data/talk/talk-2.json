    "S": "A look back on 10 years of Flutter. What we were trying to do, what we did, and where weâ€™re going! Did you know Flutter started as a web browser? Or that the first 3 versions of Flutter were in JavaScript? Or that Flutter took 4 years to reach 1.0!? This talk will walk back through some of the eras of Flutter and how I see our coming years unfolding."
